;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides methods that quickly get you to your destination inside
;; your current project, leveraging the power of git if you are using it to
;; store your code.

;; A project is defined as a directory which meets one of these conditions in
;; the following order:
;;
;; - The presence of a `.dir-locals.el' file (emacs23 style) or a
;;   `.emacs-project' file (`project-local-variables' style).
;; - The git repository that the current buffer is in.
;; - The mercurial repository the current buffer is in.
;; - The project root defined in `project-root.el', a library not included with
;;   GNU Emacs.
;; - The current default-directory if none of the above is found.

;; When we're in a git repository, we use git-ls-files and git-grep to speed up
;; our searching. Otherwise, we fallback on find statements. As a special
;; optimization, we prune ".svn" and ".hg" directories whenever we find.

;; ftf provides three main user functions:
;;
;; - `ftf-find-file' which does a filename search. It has been tested on large
;;   projects; it takes slightly less than a second from command invocation to
;;   prompt on the Chromium source tree 9,183 files as of the time of
;;   this writing).
;;
;;   It uses git-ls-files for speed when available (such as the Chromium tree),
;;   and falls back on a find statement at the project root/default-directory
;;   when git is unavailable.
;;
;; - `ftf-grepsource' which greps all the files for the escaped pattern passed
;;   in at the prompt.
;;
;;   It uses git-grep for speed when available (such as the Chromium tree),
;;   and falls back on a find|xargs grep statement when not.
;;
;; - The `with-ftf-project-root' macro, which locally changes
;;   `default-directory' to what find-things-fast thinks is the project
;;   root. Two trivial example functions, `ftf-gdb' and `ftf-compile' are
;;   provided which show it off.

;; By default, it looks only for files whose names match `ftf-filetypes'. The
;; defaults were chosen specifically for C++/Chromium development, but people
;; will probably want to override this so we provide a helper function you can
;; use in your mode hook, `ftf-add-filetypes'. Example:
;;
;; (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
;;           (lambda (ftf-add-filetypes '("*.el" "*.elisp"))))

;; If `ido-mode' is enabled, the menu will use `ido-completing-read'
;; instead of `completing-read'.

;; This file was based on the `find-file-in-project.el' by Phil Hagelberg and
;; Doug Alcorn which can be found on the EmacsWiki. Obviously, the scope has
;; greatly expanded.
